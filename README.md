Rock Paper and Scissor Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python. The player competes against the computer, which makes its choice randomly.

Game Logic...
Rock beats Scissors, 
Scissors beats Paper, 
Paper beats Rock.
If both the player and computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
